<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m someone who values clarity, purpose, and growth. I believe in
   showing up fully; whether in work, 
  learning, or relationships. I’m constantly striving to become more self-aware and intentional in 
  how I move through the world. I’m drawn to deep conversations, thoughtful challenges, 
  and environments where people are encouraged to think critically, communicate honestly, and keep evolving.</p>
